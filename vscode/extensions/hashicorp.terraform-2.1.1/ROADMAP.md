# Q3 2020 Roadmap

Each quarter, the team will highlight areas of focus for our work and upcoming research.
Each release will include necessary tasks that lead to the completion of the stated goals as well as community pull requests, enhancements, and features that are not highlighted in the roadmap. This upcoming calendar quarter (Jul-Sep 2020) we will be prioritizing the following areas of work:

## Currently In Progress
### v2.0 Release Stabilization
As HashiCorpâ€™s first version release since taking over the project, in the near term we will be focused on stabilization, adding support for multi-folder workspaces and submodules.
 
## Planned
Workflow Improvements
Integration of terraform init, plan, and apply commands.
 
### Terraform Workspace Management ([#357](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform/issues/357))
Include the ability to show the current workspace, list available workspaces, and switch between them.
 
### Terraform Cloud Integration
`terraform login` integration, and using the authentication to show information/status about your cloud workspace for the current root modules.

## Disclosures

The product-development initiatives in this document reflect HashiCorp's current plans and are subject to change and/or cancellation at HashiCorp's sole discretion.
