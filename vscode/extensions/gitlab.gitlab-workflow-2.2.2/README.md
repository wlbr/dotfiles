## Experimental Features

Experimental features are behind a feature flag. To enable them, you can set `gitlab.enableExperimentalFeatures` to `true` in your VSCode settings.

#### View issue details and comments in VSCode

![_issues-in-vscode](https://gitlab.com/fatihacet/gitlab-vscode-extension/raw/master/src/assets/_issues-in-vscode.png)

GitLab Workflow allows you to view issue details and comments right in the VSCode. Click an issue link from the sidebar and VSCode will open a new tab to show the issue details. You can also comment to the issue from VSCode. Currently, replying to discussions are not supported.

Updating assignees and labels are also not implemented. However, you can use [GitLab Slash Commands](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/slash_commands.html) to perform actions directly from VSCode. For example, to assign an issue to `@fatihacet`, simply add a comment `/assign @fatihacet` inside VSCode.


## Setup

To use this extension, you need to create a GitLab Personal Access Token and give it to the extension.

##### Step 1: Create your Personal Access Token
- If you are using
  - GitLab.com [click to open Personal Access Tokens page](https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens).
  - Self-hosted GitLab instance go to "Settings" and click "Access Tokens" on the left navigation menu
- On "Add a personal access token" form
  - Give a name to your token.
  - Select an expiry date.
  - Select "api" and "read_user" permissions.
  - Hit "Create personal access token" button.
- Copy the token. _Remember you won't be able to see the value of this token ever again for security reasons._

##### Step 2: Add token to GitLab Workflow Extension
- Open up Command Palette by pressing `Cmd+Shift+P`.
- Search for "GitLab: Set GitLab Personal Access Token" and hit Enter.
- Enter the URL to the Gitlab instance the PAT should apply to and hit Enter.
- Extension will ask for your PAT. Paste your PAT and hit Enter. _It won't be visible and accessible to others._
- If you want to connect to GitLab hosted on a custom domain, additionally set
  `gitlab.instanceUrl` in your user or workspace settings, otherwise the extension
  will try to connect to gitlab.com. See [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) for more information.

That's it. 🏁

You can start using this extension right away. If your project has a pipeline for last commit and a MR from your current branch, you should see them on VSCode status bar. 🎉

#### Multiple Gitlab instances

If you want to use multiple GitLab instances you may want to configure each workspace separately. See `gitlab.instanceUrl` config option in [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) section.


## Configuration options

**`gitlab.instanceUrl`** _(required: false, default: "https://gitlab.com")_

If you are using GitLab on a custom domain, you must add this to your user settings file. Example: `"gitlab.instanceUrl": "https://my-gitlab-domain.com"`

To enable Gitlab Workflow extension to work with different Gitlab instances, each token is assigned to a Gitlab instance URL. For the extension to selected the correct token for a specific workspace, the option [`gitlab.instanceUrl`](#configuration-options) can be used. This option can be set in the current workspace's `.vscode/settings.json` file.

**`gitlab.showStatusBarLinks`** _(required: false, default: true)_

If you don't want to see GitLab related links on the status bar, you can set this option to `false`. If you are using version 1.0.0 or above you can also find the same links in sidebar. You should restart your VSCode after updating this option.

**`gitlab.showIssueLinkOnStatusBar`** _(required: false, default: true)_

If you are not using GitLab's issue tracker, you can set this option to `false` to remove related issue link on the status bar. You should restart your VSCode after updating this option.

**`gitlab.showMrStatusOnStatusBar`** _(required: false, default: true)_

You can toggle visibility of MR link in your sidebar. You can always find MR link in GitLab Workflow sidebar. You should restart your VSCode after updating this option.

**`gitlab.ca`** _(required: false, default: null)_

If your self-hosted GitLab instance has a self-signed SSL certificate you would probably need to set this option in to point your certificate file. More discussion can be found [in this issue](https://gitlab.com/fatihacet/gitlab-vscode-extension/issues/26).

**`gitlab.cert`** _(required: false, default: null)_

If your self-hosted GitLab instance requires a custom cert/key pair you would probably need to set this option in to point your certificate file. Please also see `gitlab.certKey` option. More information [here](https://gitlab.com/fatihacet/gitlab-vscode-extension/merge_requests/29#note_132284448).

**`gitlab.certKey`** _(required: false, default: null)_

If your self-hosted GitLab instance requires a custom cert/key pair you would probably need to set this option in to point your certificate key file. Please also see `gitlab.cert` option. More information [here](https://gitlab.com/fatihacet/gitlab-vscode-extension/merge_requests/29#note_132284448).

**`gitlab.ignoreCertificateErrors`**  _(required: false, default: false)_

If you are using a self-hosted GitLab instance with no SSL certificate or having certificate issues and unable to use the extension you may want to set this option to `true` to ignore certificate errors. More information can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/fatihacet/gitlab-vscode-extension/issues/26#note_61312786).

> You can open User Settings file by pressing `Cmd+,` on Mac OS or following `Code > Preferences > User Settings`. You can simply add extension configuration values to your User Settings file. This won't break or change anything on your VSCode.

**`gitlab.remoteName`** _(required: false, default: null)_

The name of the git remote link corresponding to the GitLab repositiory with your MR and issues. If no setting is provided, the extension will detect it. For example: origin.

**`gitlab.pipelineGitRemoteName`** _(required: false, default: null)_

The name of the git remote link corresponding to the GitLab repositiory with your pipelines. If no setting is provided, the extension will detect it. For example: origin.


**`gitlab.enableExperimentalFeatures`**  _(required: false, default: false)_

To enable experimental features set this flag to `true`. List of experiemental features and details can be found [here](#experiemental-features)


## Usage
- Open up Command Palette by pressing `Cmd+Shift+P`.

## Features in-depth


### Sidebar
Extension will add a GitLab Workflow panel to sidebar of your VSCode. The dedicated panel will allow you to see the list of your issues and MRs. Also you will be able to see pipeline, MR and issue links for your current branch.

In the current version, clicking the links will open them on your default browser but the next version will allow you to interact with your issues and MRs right in your VSCode. With the upcoming versions, the extension will allow you to see the MR changes and discussions in VSCode.

![_sidebar.gif](https://gitlab.com/fatihacet/gitlab-vscode-extension/raw/master/src/assets/_sidebar.gif)


### Pipeline actions
One of the real power features of this extension is pipeline actions. This feature can be accessible from the status bar by clicking the pipeline status text or command palette and allows you to,

- View the latest pipeline on GitLab
- Create a new pipeline for your current branch
- Retry the last pipeline
- Cancel the last pipeline

![_pipeline_actions.gif](https://gitlab.com/fatihacet/gitlab-vscode-extension/raw/master/src/assets/_pipeline_actions.gif)


### Status bar
If your current project is a GitLab project, the extension will do the following things:

- Fetch pipeline of the last commit and show it on the status bar. Clicking this item will open the pipeline actions menu.
- Show open MR for current branch and show it on the status bar. Clicking this item will open MR on GitLab.
- Fetch closing issue of that MR and show it on the status bar. Clicking this item will open Issue on GitLab.

![_status_bar.gif](https://gitlab.com/fatihacet/gitlab-vscode-extension/raw/master/src/assets/_status-bar.gif)


### Advanced Search
GitLab Workflow extension provides you two types of search. Basic and advanced search. Basic search is quick however advanced search is more powerful which allows you to filter issues by author, assignee, milestone, title etc.

To use the basic search, in the search input, you can type your search term and hit Enter. This will search issues/MRs against their title and description fields. Example: `Inconsistent line endings for HEX files` or `Pipelines should ignore retried builds`.

You can perform advanced issue/MR search by using some predefined tokens. Full list below.

|Token|Description|Example|
|-|-|-|
|title|Search issues/MRs against their title and description. You don't need to add quotes around multiple words. See Important notes section.|discussions refactor|
|labels|Comma separated label list for multiple labels.|`labels: frontend, Discussion, performance`|
|label|To search with a single label. You can also have multiple `label` tokens.|`label: frontend` or `label:frontend label: Discussion`
|milestone|Milestone title without `%`.|`milestone: 9.5`|
|scope|Searches issues/MRs for the given scope. Values can be `created-by-me`, `assigned-to-me` or `all`. Defaults to `created-by-me`.|`scope: created-by-me` or `scope: assigned-to-me` or `scope: all`.|
|author|Username of the author without `@`.|`author: fatihacet`|
|assignee|Username of the assignee without `@`.|`assignee: timzallmann`|

**Examples**
- `title: new merge request widget author: fatihacet assignee: jschatz1 labels: frontend, performance milestone: 10.5`
- `title: multiple group page author: annabeldunstone assignee: timzallmann label: frontend`

**Important notes**
- `:` after the token name is necessary. `label :` is not a valid token name and may return parsing error. Hence `label:` should be used. However, space after the token name is optional. Both `label: frontend` and `label:frontend` is valid. This rule is valid for all tokens above.
- You don't need to add quotes around multiple words for `title` token. `title:"new merge request widget"` may return parsing error. `title: new merge request widget` should be used.
- You can have `labels` and `label` tokens at the same time. `labels: fronted discussion label: performance` is a valid query and all labels will be included in your search query. It's equal with `labels: fronted discussion performance`. You can also have multiple `label` tokens. `label: frontend label: discussion label: performance` is valid and equals to `labels: fronted discussion performance`.

### Create snippet
You can create a snippet from selection or entire file. You can also select visibility level of your snippet.

![_create-snippet.gif](https://gitlab.com/fatihacet/gitlab-vscode-extension/raw/master/src/assets/_create-snippet.gif)


### Compare with master
You can see changes in your branch by comparing with `master` and see them on GitLab.

![_compare-with-master.gif](https://gitlab.com/fatihacet/gitlab-vscode-extension/raw/master/src/assets/_compare-with-master.gif)

> Soon extension will support comparing your current branch with other branches.


### Open active file
This command allows you to see active file on GitLab. Extension sends active line number and selected text block to GitLab UI so you can see them highlighted.

![_open_active_file.gif](https://gitlab.com/fatihacet/gitlab-vscode-extension/raw/master/src/assets/_open_active_file.gif)


### Validate GitLab CI Configuration
Using this command, you can quickly validate GitLab CI configuration.
